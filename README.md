## About 

* This project is created using OpenCV.
* It's developed on Raspberry Pi 4 for the image processing and machine learning parts. 
* Canny edge detection is used for image processing and Haar feature-based cascade classifier is used for machine learning. 
* A slave device, Arduino Uno, is used to drive the DC motors according to the signals received from the master device, Raspberry Pi.
* Raspberry Pi Camera Module is mainly used for capturing images continuously, other than that, it's used for collecting positive and negative samples of the objects for the training process that's needed to classify them.
